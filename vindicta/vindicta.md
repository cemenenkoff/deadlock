- Grabbing **a point in Crow > Stake > Flight** really unlocks her sniper kit, allowing for
  - more reliable snipes
  - crow ricochets for waveclear and dps
  - more ammo while flying
- After **2 points in Ult**,
  - we can save for 5 points in Ult if we are snowballing, or
  - max Flight or Stake to prioritize amplifying spirit damage.

### Combos
- **Crow > Stake**
  - max dmg early harass
- **Stake > Crow**
  - more reliably hit crow
- **Stake > Crow > Snipe**
  - most reliable combo to execute target
  - lead with Crow for max dmg, but a more difficult shot.

### Tactics
- ***Use Snipe to execute targets!***
  - Snipe does more dmg to targets below 50%.
  - Snipe grants 250 bonus souls, or 600 at max lvl.
- **Use Snipe to poke sometimes.**
  - Especially when both charges are up.
- ***Abuse Flight to get picks and Snipe more reliably!***
  - Enemies have less cover from above.
- **Stake is a circular area.**
  - It does *not* wrap like a sphere.
- **Lead ability rotations with Crow.**
  - Crow scales with a target's current health,so using it at the start of a fight ensures it does the most dmg.

### Gun Style
- single shot sniper rifle with ADS, low fire rate
