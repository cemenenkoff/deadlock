### Tactics
- Throwing a Dagger does not interrupt invisibility.
- Dagger does not interrupt channeling enemies.
- Sleeping targets wake up shortly after being damaged.
- While invisible, attacking removes it.
- Enemies close by can see a translucent form of you!
- Keep in mind that Smoke Bomb invis is your only form of escape!
- Play mind games.  For example, establish a pattern of going back to buy, but then set up an ambush instead.
