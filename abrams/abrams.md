Abrams bait-and-switches enemies with lifesteal, and starts fights with charge. Most ability upgrades to lower CD do so significantly! This is why we jump around to grab lower CDs rather than max one skill at a time.
1. More Regen
2. -20s CD on Charge
3. 150 Base HP
4. -40s CD on Ult

Note that we do level up Regen twice before our ult for the 150 base health (effectively worth 468.75 souls gained instantly, plus time saved not going to the shop).

### Combos
- When charging, time pressing Q for melee exactly (or just barely after) impact for maximum burst.
- **Charge > Lifesteal > Melee**
  - The late activation of Siphon Life ensures you're in range.

### Tactics
- ***Hitting enemies against walls is essential.***
  - Narrow alleys in the jungle are perfect.
- ***Passive regen takes place over 18s***, deferring a portion of that incoming damage.
  - ***When it's a close fight, hiding for a little can give you a big advantage over your wounded opponent.***
- ***You can activate Lifesteal at any time***
  - This includes *during* other ability animations.
- ***Cover huge distances with dash-jumps and your ult for suprise ganks.***
  - Consider pairing this with the Majestic Leap item for an epic combo.

### Gun Style
- Slow shotgun with ADS.
