- Snipe is our main poking ability, so getting another charge and some damage early is key.
- All the upgrades to Owl are insane. +100 damage *then* -50s CD? And on top of that, a 22% health or lower instakill? Max ASAP after lane phase.
- Finish Snipe, then increase hard CC first (two points in trap for immobilize) with soft CC after (two points in Jump for bullet slow).

### Combos
- **Jump > Owl**
- **Jump > Charged Melee**

### Tactics
- ***The hitbox of Snipe is larger than expected.***
  - You can still hit enemies behind thin or shallow cover.
- ***Use charged melee attack (Q) while floating to maneuver quicker.***
- ***Place traps where an enemy is going to be, not where they are.***
  - Remember, there is a 2s windup time before the trap arms.
- ***Cast Owl to get up high then dive.***
  - This is much easier than weaving at street level.
- ***Owl stuns!***
  - You can interrupt Seven (sphere AoE) or Bebop (hyperbeam)!
