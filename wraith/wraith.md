- We always start with card, as it's our main poke.
- After upgrading card to full burst, we grab extended range on teleport to become a slippery split pusher.

### Combos
- **Continuously Fire > Card > Continuously Fire**
- **Continuously Fire > Stim w/ Quicksilver Reload**

### Tactics
- ***Use Card's splash damage*** to hit enemies behind cover or thin walls.
- ***Splitpushing is a good idea***, but always have an escape plan (e.g. Teleport).
- ***Teleport can go anywhere within a sphere.***
  - You can even teleport to a place that is simply mid-air.
  - This is useful for unpredictable movement as well as chasing.
- ***Stim helps trooper waves and teammates too***.
- ***Telekinesis can get countered***, so be mindful of enemies with skills that can dodge it (e.g. Mo and Krill) or items that deny it (e.g. Ethereal Shift).
- ***Assign Quicksilver Reload to Stim*** so that any time an activation is needed, you have a full clip.
  - This is useful for surprise skirmishes as well as stepping forward to hit objectives when a timing window opens up.
